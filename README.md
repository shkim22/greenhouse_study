# Do We Need More Babies to Save the Planet?: A Study on Greenhouse Gas Emissions & Population Growth

## Background

The increase in greenhouse gases (GHG) since the industrial revolution has had an undeniably detrimental impact on our environment, with carbon emissions making up a majority of the GHG emissions. At the same time, the worldâ€™s population has increased rapidly, but the population growth rate is increasingly slowing and experts predict that population will peak and decline in the near future. Over the last 100 years, the global population more than quadrupled but the growth rate has slowed.


## Initial Hypothesis

It is commonly thought that population growth negatively contributes to climate change and other environmental problems. The purpose of our analysis is to examine if and how population growth contributes to GHG emissions. Our hypothesis is that population growth does not significantly contribute to increased GHG emissions. In fact, we do not expect population to be the largest contributing factor to the increase in GHG emissions.

# Directory Structure

## Requirements.txt
This file contains all the necessary libraries that are needed to run the code.

## Data Wrangling
We used 'Data Transformation.ipynb' to convert all the data into a format where we could combined with the rest of the variables.

## Code
This folder includes most of our EDA work, from data visualization, and data wrangling. 

## Final Code
"Team 64 Code File.Rmd" includes the bulk of the modeling and analysis of the data. We go through several iterations of Linear Regression to achieve a good performance.
